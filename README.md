# RG-GAN
Representation-guided Generative Adversarial Network for Unpaired Photo-to-caricature Translation

We developed a representation-guided generative adversarial network (RG-GAN) designed to create a vivid caricature appearance from a photo with an imitated painting style.

Illustration of the proposed framework. Given one reference image, the goal is to translate a photo image to a caricature using a painting style similar to the given reference image.

Visual comparison of the outputs of different methods. Our RG-GAN captures the personal characteristics from the reference images and combines them with the extracted representation during the translation procedure.


We will release the codes soon...
